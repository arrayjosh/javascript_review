# JavaScript Study Guide
This study guide is intended as a review to make sure you are ready for a job as a front-end web developer. If you feel comfortable with the following concepts and topics, then you should be able to pass junior level coding challenges and land a job!

It doesn't help to just read the links I've inserted below, make sure you play with all of these tools and concepts in your own test code until you are comfortable using them!

* Practice using the JavaScript [typeof](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof) operator.

  * Practice counting numbers in an array.
  * Practice counting characters in a string.

  * How are splice and slice different?
  * Practice using the [map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) method.
  * Practice using the [filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) method.
  * Practice using the [join](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join) method.

* Understand Number methods in JavaScript.
  * Practice using the [toFixed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed) method to limit floating point numbers to a few decimal points.
  * Practice turning strings into numbers.
  * Practice using the [modulo](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators) operator to test if one number is divisible by another.
